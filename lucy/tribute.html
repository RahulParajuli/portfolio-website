          <h2> A journey that changed his life</h2>
          <p>Cheburashka used to live in a thick tropical forest until one day he crossed an ocean, or even two, in a box of oranges and found himself in a big city: he had climbed inside the box to take breakfast but after eating two fruits, he felt tired and fell asleep. He didn’t notice when the boxes were nailed shut and loaded onto a ship.</p>
          <p>According to the book, Cheburashka’s name comes from the Russian verb “cheburakhnutsya” meaning “to topple.” For example, after he ate too many oranges during his trip in the box and his legs became numb, he couldn’t stand and toppled over every time.
          The word Cheburashka is also used to indicate a cork-tumbler or a tilting doll. </p>

          <h4> Gena the Crocodile</h4>
          <p>In the big city Cheburashka felt lonely until one day he made two friends. Krokodil Gena, or Gena the Crocodile, a 50-year-old young Crocodile (the crocs live up to 300 years). He’s been working in a local Zoo as … Crocodile. He spent all his spare time reading books, newspapers and all kind of encyclopedias (Russopedia maybe?) or playing oaths and crosses with himself. He also liked smoking pipes and good clothing – especially suits, coats and hats. On his birthday he sang a song that became a special birthday song in Russia.</p>

          <p> Cheburashka’s second friend was Galya, a little girl and a promising actress in a local children’s theater. 
          The friends gathered every evening to chat and take coffee. They set up a Friendship House – a kind of friend’s exchange, to help everyone looking for friends. </p>

          <p>Starukha Shapoklyak, or Old Lady Shapoklyak, named after an ancient opera hat “shapoklyak,” from French <em>chapeau claque</em>, is the main antagonist of the three friends. A tall and lean old woman, she “collects evil and bad deeds” claiming “good acts will never make you famous.” Her best friend is an ugly rat named Lariska who she keeps in her handbag.</p>
